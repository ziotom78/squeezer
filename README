This is the preliminary version of a program that compresses LFI
detector pointings using a variety of (mostly) lossy algorithms. The
input to the program is a set of detector pointing files (these can be
either FITS files or objects in the Planck/LFI DMC database), and the
output is a set of binary files containing the compressed detector
pointings.

The amount of compression depends on a variety of factors, and it can
be tuned according to the user's wishes.

The requirements for compiling Squeezer are:

   * CFITSIO (required)
   * GNU GSL (required)
   * CppUnit (optional, it allows the user to run "make check")
   * TOODI (optional, it allows the program to get the pointings from
     the Planck/LFI DPC database)

Refer to the INSTALL file to learn how to compile and install the
program.
